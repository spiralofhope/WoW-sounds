Modifications (mostly muting) various World of Warcraft sounds.

# Intro

I was sick and tired of a whole range of sounds.  I did a lot of searching and I found "Silencer" for Hunter guns.  From there, I was able to hunt down a number of annoying sounds and package them all together.

With many thanks to [AudioX II](https://wow.curseforge.com/addons/audiox/), without which this would have been bloody annoying to do.

To use, simply unzip this to your `World of Warcraft\Data\Sound` directory.  By default, this directory is completely empty.  On startup, when appropriately-named .wav files are seen by the game, it will use the new sound instead.

# Possibly-controversial changes

- `Tradeskills\AlchemyCraftingA..C`
- `Tradeskills\BlackSmithCraftingA..E`
- `Tradeskills\Engineering`
- `Tradeskills\Leatherworking`

The music at the login screen:

- `Music\cataclysm\MUS_Shattering_UU01.mp3`

Muting the miners in Exodar also mutes all player mining:

- `\Spells\Tradeskills\MiningHitA..E`

The error sounds:

- `Spells\Fizzle\*`


# Misc

- Blacksmiths at anvils (forced to mute both players and NPCs)

- [M4A1 Carbine Silencer/Suppressor/Crossbow/Bow](https://wow.curseforge.com/addons/m4a1-carbine-silencersuppressor/)
  -  There are a few Gun Silencer mods that replace Blizzard's ear deafening default gun sounds, and most of the ones I have found weren't very high quality. So I decided to make my own, with HI-DEF silencer recordings. 
  -  1 Silenced Gun Shot (M4A1 Carbine)
  -  3 Unique Reload Sounds 

- [No More Stomp Sounds](https://wow.curseforge.com/addons/nmss/)
  -  Tired of hearing Devilsaurs, Magma Core Hounds and all these exotics pets stomping ? Well that mod is made for you :D
  -  [Thanks for saving me the bother of testing if 0-byte wav files would work.]

# Mounts

- [Quiet That Horse!](http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/qth.aspx) (down)
  -  The shriek of the Death Knight Charger being summoned was novel and interesting for a while, but it quickly grew incredibly grating. This tiny modification changes the spell noise to a more subdued, but still atmospheric, roll of muted thunder.
  -  Quiet That Horse! was re-used for the paladin mount
  -  I notice there is [Kill That Horse!](https://www.curseforge.com/projects/19772/), which was not checked.

- Mount jumping-in-place:
  - Elekk
  - Horse
  - Tyrael's Charger
